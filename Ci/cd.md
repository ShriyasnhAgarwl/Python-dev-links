 - 𝗖𝗼𝗻𝘁𝗶𝗻𝘂𝗼𝘂𝘀 𝗜𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗴𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 (𝗖𝗜): Imagine you and your friends are each working on different parts of this LEGO tower.

It would be chaos if everyone tried to put their pieces together at the end, right?

Things might not fit, or the tower could collapse because something was not right.

So, instead, each time you or a friend adds a new part (like a new piece of code), you immediately attach it to the tower (or "integrate" it).

That way, you can quickly see if it fits right or if it makes the tower unstable, and fix any problems when they're still small and manageable.

- 𝗖𝗼𝗻𝘁𝗶𝗻𝘂𝗼𝘂𝘀 𝗗𝗲𝗹𝗶𝘃𝗲𝗿𝘆 (𝗖𝗗): Now, suppose you want to show your LEGO tower to your parents every evening when they come back from work.

You wouldn't want to show them a tower that's not stable or is incomplete, right?

So, you make sure that the tower is always in a state that's good enough to show off (like a program that's ready to be delivered).

Each time you add a piece, you also make sure it's attached properly and looks good (you "deliver" it).

That way, your LEGO tower is always ready to be presented.

So, CI/CD in the world of coding is like constantly adding to and improving your LEGO tower, and always having it ready to show off.

In actuality,

- Continuous Integration (CI) a development practice where developers integrate code into a shared repository frequently, preferably several times a day.

Each integration is then automatically verified and tested to detect integration errors as quickly as possible.

This approach allows teams to identify and address bugs quicker, improve software quality, and reduce the time it takes to validate and release new software updates.


- Continuous Delivery (CD) is an extension of continuous integration.

It involves automatically preparing the code for release to production after passing a series of tests.

The goal is to have a codebase that is always ready for deployment to a live environment.

- 𝗝𝗲𝗻𝗸𝗶𝗻𝘀 𝗣𝗶𝗽𝗲𝗹𝗶𝗻𝗲𝘀: Jenkins is an open-source automation server, and a Jenkins Pipeline is a suite of plugins that supports implementing and integrating continuous delivery pipelines into Jenkins.

A pipeline has an extensible automation server for creating simple or complex delivery pipelines "as code" via pipeline DSL (Domain-specific Language).

Remember, CI/CD isn't a one-size-fits-all solution; it's more of a philosophy or set of practices tailored to an organization's specific needs.

If you're not using CI/CD, you're missing out on a number of benefits.
